A man died and because he had been a good person, he went to Heaven, where Saint Peter greeted him at the door.Welcome! he said. You can enter Heaven right away, but, because you lived such a good life, you can also go and check out Hell first, if you like.The man was rather curious and said – well, why not – and he went down all the stairs to reach the door of Hell, which opened before him.Behind the door, he saw many people sitting around tables with delicious food! But they were all very sad, and suffering, because instead of hands they had long knives and forks as arm extensions and they did not manage to put any of this great food in their mouths. The man went back up to Heaven and said to Saint Peter: Wow, am I glad that I can go to Heaven. That is really some punishment.Welcome to Heaven, Saint Peter said, as he let the man in.What did he see there? He saw many people sitting around tables with delicious food, just like in Hell!And just like in Hell, they also had these long fork and knife extensions on their arms!But in Heaven, the people weren't crying or cursing, because they were sticking the food in each other’s mouths! “Try this”, they laughed. “And this!”, and they had lots of fun in the process.
