## Once a thief

I was still a thief when I met Arun. And though I was only fifteen years old, 
I was an experienced and fairly successful hand. Arun was watching a 
wrestling match when I approached him. He was about twenty-five and he 
looked easygoing, kind, and simple enough for my purpose. I was sure I 
would be able to win the young man’s confidence.

“You look a bit of a wrestler yourself,” I said. There’s nothing like flattery to 
break the ice!
“So do you,” he replied, which put me off for a moment because at that time 
I was rather thin and bony.
“Well,” I said modestly, “I do wrestle a bit.”
“What’s your name?”
“Hari Singh,” I lied. I took a new name every month, which kept me ahead 
of the police and former employers.
After these formalities Arun confined himself to commenting on the 
wrestlers, who were grunting, gasping, and heaving each other about. 
When he walked away, I followed him casually.
“Hello again,” he said.
I gave him my most appealing smile. “I want to work for you,” I said.
“But I can’t pay you anything—not for some time, anyway.”
I thought that over for a minute. Perhaps I had misjudged my man.
“Can you feed me?” I asked.
“Can you cook?”
“I can cook,” I lied again.
“If you can cook, then maybe I can feed you.”

He took me to his room over the Delhi Sweet Shop and told me I could 
sleep on the balcony. But the meal I cooked that night must have been 
terrible because Arun gave it to a stray dog and told me to be off. But I just 
hung around, smiling in my most appealing way, and he couldn’t help 
laughing.

Later, he said never mind, he’d teach me to cook. He also taught me to 
write my name and said he would soon teach me to write whole sentences 
and to add figures. I was grateful. I knew that once I could write like an 
educated person, there would be no limit to what I could achieve.

It was quite pleasant working for Arun. I made tea in the morning and then 
took my time buying the day’s supplies, usually making a profit of two or 
three rupees. I think he knew I made a little money this way, but he didn’t 
seem to mind.

Arun made money by fits and starts. He would borrow one week, lend the 
next. He kept worrying about his next check, but as soon as it arrived he 
would go out and celebrate. He wrote for the Delhi and Bombay 
magazines: a strange way to make a living.

One evening he came home with a small bundle of notes, saying he had 
just sold a book to a publisher. That night I saw him put the money in an 
envelope and tuck it under the mattress.

I had been working for Arun for almost a month and, apart from the 
cheating on the shopping, had not done anything in my real line of work. I 
had every opportunity for doing so. I could come and go as I pleased, and 
Arun was the most trusting person I had ever met.

That was why it was so difficult to rob him. It was easy for me to rob a 
greedy man. But robbing a nice man could be a problem. And if he doesn’t 
notice he’s being robbed, then all the spice goes out of the undertaking?
Well, it’s time I got down to some real work, I told myself. If I don’t take the 
money, he’ll only waste it on his so-called friends. After all, he doesn’t even 
give me a salary.

Arun was sleeping peacefully. A beam of moonlight reached over the 
balcony and fell on his bed. I sat on the floor, considering the situation. If I 
took the money, I could catch the 10:30 express to Lucknow. Slipping out 
of my blanket, I crept over to the bed.

My hand slid under the mattress, searching for the notes. When I found the 
packet, I drew it out without a sound. Arun sighed in his sleep and turned 
on his side. Startled, I moved quickly out of the room.

Once on the road, I began to run. I had the money stuffed into a vest 
pocket under my shirt. When I’d gotten some distance from Arun's place, I 
slowed to a walk and, taking the envelope from my pocket, counted the 
money. Seven hundred rupees in fifties. I could live like a prince for a 
week or two!

When I reached the station, I did not stop at the ticket office (I had never 
bought a ticket in my life) but dashed straight to the platform. The Lucknow express was just moving out. The train had still to pick up speed and I should have been able to jump into one of the compartments, but I 
hesitated—for some reason I can’t explain—and I lost the chance to get 
away.

When the train had gone, I found myself standing alone on the deserted 
platform. I had no idea where to spend the night. I had no friends, 
believing that friends were trouble than help. And I did not want to arouse 
curiosity by staying at one of the small hotels nearby. The only person I 
knew really well was the man I had robbed. Leaving the station, I walked 
slowly through the bazaar.

In my short career, I had made a study of people’s faces after they had 
discovered the loss of their valuables. The greedy showed panic; the rich 
showed anger; the poor, resignation. But I knew that Arun's face when he 
discovered the theft would show only a touch of sadness—not for the loss 
of money, but for the loss of trust.

The night was chilly—November nights can be cold in northern India—and 
a shower of rain added to my discomfort. I sat down in the shelter of the 
clock tower. A few beggars and vagrants lay beside me, rolled up tight in 
their blankets. The clock showed midnight. I felt for the notes; they were 
soaked through.

Arun’s money. In the morning he would probably have given me five 
rupees to go to the movies, but now I had it all: no more cooking meals, 
running to the bazaar, or learning to write sentences.

Sentences! I had forgotten about them in the excitement of the theft. 
Writing complete sentences, I knew, could one day bring me more than a 
few hundred rupees. It was a simple matter to steal. But to be a really big 
man, a clever and respected man, was something else. I should go back to 
Arun, I told myself, if only to learn to read and write.

I hurried back to the room feeling very nervous, for it is much easier to steal something than to return it undetected. I opened the door quietly, then stood in the doorway in clouded moonlight. 

Arun was still asleep. I crept to the head of the bed, and my hand came up 
with the packet of notes. I felt his breath on my hand. I remained still for a 
few moments. Then my fingers found the edge of the mattress, and I 
slipped the money beneath it.

I awoke late the next morning to find that Arun had already made the tea. 
He stretched out a hand to me. There was a fifty-rupee note between his fingers. 
My heart sank.

“I made some money yesterday,” he said. “Now I’ll be able to pay you 
regularly.”

My spirits rose. But when I took the note, I noticed that it was still wet from 
the night’s rain. So he knew what I’d done. But neither his lips nor his eyes 
revealed anything.

“Today we’ll start writing sentences,” he said.

I smiled at Arun in my most appealing way. And the smile came by itself, 
without any effort.
