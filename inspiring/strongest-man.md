## The strongest man on the island

There is an old story about two Greek islanders vying to become the strongest man on the island. 

One trainee bought a newborn calf. The other laughed at him. How could a calf help his rival train? But every day the wise trainee lifted it. Every day the calf got a little bigger and heavier but he could still lift it because it was only a little bit heavier than the previous day. After a year the wise trainee saw the calf was now a bull but he could still lift it. 

In the meantime the unwise trainee had tried every day to lift a bull. 

He had failed every time.
