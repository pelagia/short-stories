## The new ruler

The king of Rajhgarh had grown old and was counting his last days. He had two sons..

 He was baffled that who should take his responsibilities of the throne after him.   He then wrote his will, in which he mentioned a competition in which the horse of the prince finishing last will win.. and he will only be the new king..

The old king died.... 

The day the will (written by the old king) was revised, The same  competition (which was mentioned in the will)  was organised  in the city but both the princes were in dilemma that if their horses should finish last then how much slow they had to move.. 
In the attempt to move behind from other they almost stopped moving..
Days passed, but with no result..
Finally irritated with such a competition they went to a sanyasi (wise man).

They explained everything to him.. And the Sanyasi laughed and said exchange your horses!!!

Now to keep their horses behind they had to move faster than the other who was riding his horse..

And finally Rajgarh got it's new ruler..
