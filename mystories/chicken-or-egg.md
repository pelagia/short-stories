## Chicken or egg

His father always strongly believed that there was initially a chicken. In contrast, he could not understand how a chicken can be without an egg.

His father had all sorts of reasons. For example the father knew that in the village where he used to live, he saw one day a lorry with one hundred chickens coming and later they started an egg-factory in the village. He also read in a religious book that God created everything in seven days; among those chicken. He knew that everything before it appeared on earth had first its being in the spirit.

He, on the other hand, went to school and he learned from his courses in philosophy that every effect can only be understood as consequence of a cause. He also studied Darwin’s theory of evolution. He knew that chicken became chicken through a slow process of evolution. In fact a proto-chicken gave birth to the official chicken and since the real-life official chicken came out of the egg of another chicken-like bird, therefore egg came first.

There was a long night where he and his father were discussing, each strongly object the other, while they heard a voice from the kitchen. It was mom saying: “I do not know which one was first, chicken or egg. While you were discussing I made a chicken-egg salad. You must both be hungry. Aren’t you?”
