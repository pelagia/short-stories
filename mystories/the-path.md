## The path

When he was a kid, he asked his father: "Dad! Why should he study?"
- "To become an educated person" dad answered.
- "Why should I become an educated person?" he asked curiously.
- "To get a good job, a good life"
- "And why should I get one?"
- "To become rich and happy!"
Back then, his dad taught him a lesson: "try hard to become successful and eventually happy.."
He grew up, tried hard, and earned a good amount of money but he was searching for something that he could not understand.
He was searching for it everywhere, moving from country to country and he realized some day that what his dad told him was not very true. 
He realized that nothing that he was told was absolutely true and nothing that he had had in mind was necessarily true.
One day, he was watching an old man with a kid in a train. "Grandpa! Why should I go to school?" asked the kid.
"Everyone is here for a reason my son! You go to school to educate yourself to find the reason that you are born for.
If school does not answer your question, go find your answer somewhere else.
You are here for a reason my son. If you find your reason and devote yourself to your reason you will be content and everything will be fine.."
 . He got off the train in the next stop while the kid was happily watching the railway continuing his journey.
