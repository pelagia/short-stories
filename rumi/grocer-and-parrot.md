## The grocer and the parrot

Once, a grocer had a talkative, green parrot with a beautiful voice.
The parrot stayed in the grocer's shop all day long, entertaining the customers with delightful words and jokes.
The parrot, who knew how to speak with people just like a human, was also an expert at chirping melodies.
One day, the grocer had to leave his shop for a short while to go on an errand.
As the parrot was flitting about on its own in the shop, it suddenly knocked over a huge bottle of rose oil.
What did the grocer behold when he returned to the shop?
All was in disarray and everything in the shop was splattered with rose oil.
The grocer's own robe was also stained with rose oil.
Angered by the parrot's naughty antics, the grocer slapped the bird on the head.
The parrot was very upset by this blow, and soon after, it began to lose its feathers. 

Then, the parrot became silent and withdrawn and began to observe its master sadly from a corner. 
When the grocer saw this, he felt sorry that he had hurt the poor creature and regretted a thousand times over what he had done. 
But in vain! The grocer, who soon thereafter watched his parrot lose the last of its beautiful feathers and remain bald, was left stroking his beard, mumbling, "If only my hand had been broken so I wouldn't have struck such a fine-tongued creature. 
The grocer began to shower alms on the poor and helped many others in hopes that his bird might come to its senses and speak again. 
Three days and three nights passed with the grocer sitting dejectedly in his shop. However, at the same time he went on chatting with the parrot, 
hoping that his foolish banter might encourage it to speak again. 
Just then, a man without a single hair on his head came in from the street. 
Breaking its long silence, the parrot suddenly began to squawk with excitement, 
"Hey, baldy! Look at me! Did you knock over a bottle of rose oil, too?" 
All the passers-by who heard this began to laugh.
The parrot apparently believed that this ascetic, a man who had donned a vest and shaved his head for spiritual reasons, 
was bald because he had spilled a bottle of rose oil and been slapped by his master, just like the parrot! 

## حکایت مرد بقال و طوطی و روغن ریختن طوطی در دکان 

بقالی طوطی زیبا و خوش نوایی داشت و با مشتریان نکته ها می گفت و آنان را به خود سرگرم می داشت و هروقت که بقال از دکان بیرون می رفت طوطی مواظب دکانش می شد . 
روزی طوطی در دکان به پرواز در آمد و شیشه های روغن گل را بر زمین ریخت . بقال ضربتی بر سر طوطی نواخت که پرهای سرش فرو ریخت و تا چند روز از سخن گفتن و بانگ بر آوردن خود داری کرد و این گذشت تا اینکه روزی مرد طاسی از کنار دکان می گذشت و همینکه چشم طوطی به او اقتاد خیال کرد که طاسی آن نیز سببی مانند طاسی او دارد پس ناگهان طوطی به سخن آمد و از آن مرد پرسید تو مگر از شیشه روغن ریختی؟ مردم از شنیدن این سخن و مقایسه طوطی به خنده افتادند زیرا که طوطی قیاس نابجا کرده بود و طاسی خود را با طاسی آن مرد یکی فرض کرده بود.

مولانا در این داستان ضمن ایراد نکته های ظریف عرفانی قیاس ناروا و مقایسه های بیجایی که معمولا میان مردم رواج دارد مورد نقد قرار داده است .
