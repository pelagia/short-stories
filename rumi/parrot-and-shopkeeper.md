## The parrot and the shopkeeper

A shopkeeper had a smart talking parrot. It would take care of the shop in its 
owner’s absence and would prattle with the customers. It was amusing for 
all. One day, when the parrot was usually busy taking care of the shop, a cat 
jumped after a mouse in the shop. The parrot afraid of cat jumped in the 
middle and many bottles were deranged. The expensive oils and extracts 
were wasted and the shop was a mess. The shopkeeper was returning from 
happily; he was bewildered to see the mess. He was so much angered that 
he caused a heavy blow at parrot’s head that it lost all its feathers and 
became bald. The parrot was dumbfounded. It took to heart the shopkeeper’
s blow and stopped to talk.  The shopkeeper felt sorry, he repented that why 
he had ever hit that bird? He did his best to regain parrot’s speech: gave 
charity to poor showed him wonderful and amazing things, but parrot did not 
utter a word. One day the parrot saw a bald dervish passing by. Parrot at 
once exclaimed! “O bald One! What happened to your hair? You too had 
spilt oil from jars?” The passers-by smiled at the parrot's keen assumption: 
It took Dervish to its own likeness. Can a parrot and a dervish share the 
same disposition?

Parrot is just an imitator; it is not a scholar. The imitators can entertain or 
indulge in discursive knowledge but they cannot construct knowledge. 
Rumi here explains the difference between discursive logic and spiritual 
enlightening. All knowledge is not pure and constructive; all scholars 
cannot guide people to the right path. Knowledge is Power but it is 
mastered by genuine and brave persons like Moses while it prisons fake 
and guile sorcerers. True knowledge is liberating; it is acquired by heart and 
not through sense perception. All senses but mislead men. We see what we 
want to see and hear what we want to hear.

## حکایت مرد بقال و طوطی و روغن ریختن طوطی در دکان 

بقالی طوطی زیبا و خوش نوایی داشت و با مشتریان نکته ها می گفت و آنان را به خود سرگرم می داشت و هروقت که بقال از دکان بیرون می رفت طوطی مواظب دکانش می شد . 
روزی طوطی در دکان به پرواز در آمد و شیشه های روغن گل را بر زمین ریخت . بقال ضربتی بر سر طوطی نواخت که پرهای سرش فرو ریخت و تا چند روز از سخن گفتن و بانگ بر آوردن خود داری کرد و این گذشت تا اینکه روزی مرد طاسی از کنار دکان می گذشت و همینکه چشم طوطی به او اقتاد خیال کرد که طاسی آن نیز سببی مانند طاسی او دارد پس ناگهان طوطی به سخن آمد و از آن مرد پرسید تو مگر از شیشه روغن ریختی؟ مردم از شنیدن این سخن و مقایسه طوطی به خنده افتادند زیرا که طوطی قیاس نابجا کرده بود و طاسی خود را با طاسی آن مرد یکی فرض کرده بود.

مولانا در این داستان ضمن ایراد نکته های ظریف عرفانی قیاس ناروا و مقایسه های بیجایی که معمولا میان مردم رواج دارد مورد نقد قرار داده است .
