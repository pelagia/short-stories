## The rabbit and the lion

The herd of wild animals that had come to graze in the beautiful meadow did so crouched down in fear of a lion. Indeed, a lion often laid an ambush in this meadow, snatching up and carrying away one of the animals. So, the fertile pasture was spoiled for them. The poor animals wracked their brains until at last they went to the lion and offered to bring him anything he wanted to eat, as long as he would not touch them. However, the lion, wise in the ways of the world, realized that they might be laying a trap for him and did not accept their offer. "I prefer to earn my own living," he said. The animals swore to be true to their word and finally succeeded in convincing the lion. According to their agreement, the lion's portion was to be brought before him each day without any trouble. The animals would draw lots to determine which one of them was to become the lion's meal so that the others could graze in peace.

One day, the rabbit drew the lot and so it was known that he would be sent to the lion. At this, the rabbit protested, crying, How long will this oppression last? The other wild animals urged the rabbit, -All this time we've remained true to our word and sacrificed our own lives. Don't you dare act stubbornly and ruin our good name! Get going so the lion won't be insulted!" The rabbit pleaded with his friends for a little more time. -I have a plan," he said to them, that could save both my life and yours." Although the other animals insisted, they were not able to find out what the rabbit intended to do. The rabbit headed toward where the lion lived and arrived just a little late. Upon seeing his prey come late, the lion roared violently and clawed the earth. He was thinking that he was wrong to have made a deal with the animals. Besides, this rabbit was heading toward him with very slow hops. The lion steamed up and boiled over with anger as he watched the rabbit coming from far away. Seeing the rabbit's relaxed demeanor, he exploded. "Just who do you think you are? I've torn apart elephants, not to mention a thousand or so rabbits," he roared. The rabbit begged the lion to forgive him and offered his excuse: "Honestly, my lord. I set out early this morning. With another rabbit as my companion, I was hurrying to your presence, when along the way, we were attacked by another lion. I begged and pleaded. 'Don't kill us. We are slaves of the King of kings,' I said. 'Who is that king?' die strange lion replied. 'I'll tear him to pieces.' 'Just let me see my king one last time and I'll tell him about you,' I said. 'If you leave your friend as a hostage, I'll let you go,' the strange lion replied. All my begging and pleading was useless; he took my friend and let me go. Of course, my friend is very attractive and also two times plumper than I am." The hungry lion, enraged by this news, commanded the rabbit to show him the enemy who had trespassed on his preserves. He said, If you're telling the truth, then lead me there, and let's give that lion his due. But if you're lying, I'll punish you." The rabbit led the way, hoping to draw the lion into the trap he had laid for him. Soon, they came to the top of a deep well. The rabbit said, "Look, there they are, both of them," and he pointed into the well. As he approached the well, the lion noticed that the rabbit had hopped backwards. "Why did you hop back?" he asked. "Don't stay back there. Get in front of me!" "Don't you see that I'm trembling? My paws are shaking and my heart is in my throat" replied the rabbit. The lion told the rabbit to look into the well and see if the lion he had met was there or not. The rabbit said, "If you hold me in your lap, then be able to look." 

As the lion took the rabbit onto his lap and leaned over to look into the well, he saw another lion and a fat rabbit there. Thinking that he saw his enemy in the water, he pushed the rabbit from his lap and leaned into the well. When the lion jumped onto his own reflection in the water, he was unable to climb out of the well again and drowned. The rabbit, who had managed to get rid of the lion by deceiving him into his trap, bounced up and down with glee and immediately hopped back to his friends to tell them the good news. All of the animals joyfully hugged the rabbit, congratulated him and thanked him for saving their lives. 

## ترک جهد گفتن نخچیران به شیر

در مرغزاری دلکش و فرح انگیز وحوش در ناز و نعمت می زیستند ولی شیری در آن حوالی بود که عیش آنان را ناگوار کرده بود . روزی این حیوانات دور هم جمع شدند و نزد شیر رفتند و گفتند ای پادشاه تو هر روز با رنج و سختی فراوان یکی از ما را شکار می کنی و ما پیوسته در بیم و هراسیم و تو در رنج و تلاش . اکنون به تو این پیشنهاد را می کنیم که هر روز به حکم قرعه یکی از حیوانات را از میان خودمان انتخاب می کنیم و نزد تو می فرستیم تا طمعه تو شود . با این کار هم خیال ما آسوده می شود و هم تو از رنج شکار و تلاش فارغ می شود وحوش پس از این قول و قرار به تعهد خود وفا می کردند تا اینکه روزی قرعه به نام خرگوش درآمد وی از دوستانش خواست که کمی درنگ کنند تا او نیرنگی به کار گیرد و برای همیشه شر شیر را از سر آن ها دفع کند . آنان پذیرفتند و خرگوش به آرامی به کنام شیر نزدیک شد و او را سخت خشمگین یافت و برای عذر تاخیر خود گفت شاها من خرگوشی را به عنوان طعمه شما می آوردم که در میانه راه شیری بیگانه آن را از من گرفت و برد شیر از شنیدن این خبر سخت آشفته و پرتاب شد و از خرگوش خواست که او را به محل آن شیر متجاوز ببرد و بالاخره خرگوش شیر را به سرچاهی برد شیر چون به ته چاه نگاه کرد تصویرش بر آب افتاد و گمان کرد که واقعا شیری در آنجا وجود دارد پس بیدرنگ به منظور جنگ با او خود را به درون چاه انداخت و به هلاکت رسید و وحوش جنگل از دست آن شیرجان ستان رها شدند .
