## The coffee house of Surat by Tolstoy

In the town of Surat, in India, was a coffeehouse
where many travellers and foreigners from all
parts of the world met and conversed.
One day a learned Persian theologian visited
this coffee-house. He was a man who had spent his
life studying the nature of the Deity, and reading and
writing books upon the subject. He had thought, read,
and written so much about God, that eventually he lost
his wits, became quite confused, and ceased even to
believe in the existence of a God. The Shah, hearing of
this, had banished him from Persia.
After having argued all his life about the First
Cause, this unfortunate theologian had ended by quite
perplexing himself, and instead of understanding that
he had lost his own reason, he began to think that there
was no higher Reason controlling the universe.
This man had an African slave who followed
him everywhere. When the theologian entered the
coffee-house, the slave remained outside, near the door,
sitting on a stone in the glare of the sun, and driving
away the flies that buzzed around him. The Persian
having settled down on a divan in the coffee-house,
ordered himself a cup of opium. When he had drunk
it and the opium had begun to quicken the workings
of his brain, he addressed his slave through the open
door:
“Tell me, wretched slave,” said he, “do you think
there is a God, or not?”
“Of course there is,” said the slave, and
immediately drew from under his girdle a small idol of
wood.
“There,” said he, “that is the God who has
guarded me from the day of my birth. Every one in
our country worships the fetish tree, from the wood of
which this God was made.”
This conversation between the theologian and
his slave was listened to with surprise by the other
guests in the coffee-house. They were astonished at the
master’s question, and yet more so at the slave’s reply.
One of them, a Brahmin, on hearing the words
spoken by the slave, turned to him and said:
“Miserable fool! Is it possible you believe that
God can be carried under a man’s girdle? There is one
God--Brahma, and he is greater than the whole world,
for he created it. Brahma is the One, the mighty God,
and in His honour are built the temples on the Ganges’
banks, where his true priests, the Brahmins, worship
him. They know the true God, and none but they. A
thousand score of years have passed, and yet through
revolution after revolution these priests have held their
sway, because Brahma, the one true God, has protected
them.”
So spoke the Brahmin, thinking to convince
every one; but a Jewish broker who was present replied
to him, and said:
“No! the temple of the true God is not in India.
Neither does God protect the Brahmin caste. The true
God is not the God of the Brahmins, but of Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob. None does He protect but His chosen
people, the Israelites. From the commencement of the
world, our nation has been beloved of Him, and ours
alone. If we are now scattered over the whole earth, it is
but to try us; for God has promised that He will one day
gather His people together in Jerusalem. Then, with the
Temple of Jerusalem--the wonder of the ancient world-
-restored to its splendor, shall Israel be established a
ruler over all nations.”
So spoke the Jew, and burst into tears. He
wished to say more, but an Italian missionary who was
there interrupted him.
“What you are saying is untrue,” said he to the
Jew. “You attribute injustice to God. He cannot love
your nation above the rest. Nay rather, even if it be true
that of old He favored the Israelites, it is now nineteen
hundred years since they angered Him, and caused Him
to destroy their nation and scatter them over the earth,
so that their faith makes no converts and has died out
except here and there. God shows preference to no
nation, but calls all who wish to be saved to the bosom
of the Catholic Church of Rome, the one outside whose
borders no salvation can be found.”
So spoke the Italian. But a Protestant minister,
who happened to be present, growing pale, turned to
the Catholic missionary and exclaimed:
“How can you say that salvation belongs to
your religion? Those only will be saved, who serve
God according to the Gospel, in spirit and in truth, as
bidden by the word of Christ.”
Then a Turk, an office-holder in the custom-

house at Surat, who was sitting in the coffee-house
smoking a pipe, turned with an air of superiority to
both the Christians.
“Your belief in your Roman religion is vain,”
said he. “It was superseded twelve hundred years ago
by the true faith: that of Mohammed! You cannot
but observe how the true Mohammed faith continues
to spread both in Europe and Asia, and even in the
enlightened country of China. You say yourselves that
God has rejected the Jews; and, as a proof, you quote the
fact that the Jews are humiliated and their faith does not
spread. Confess then the truth of Mohammedanism,
for it is triumphant and spreads far and wide. None will
be saved but the followers of Mohammed, God’s latest
prophet; and of them, only the followers of Omar, and
not of Ali, for the latter are false to the faith.”
To this the Persian theologian, who was of the
sect of Ali, wished to reply; but by this time a great dispute
had arisen among all the strangers of different faiths
and creeds present. There were Abyssinian Christians,
Llamas from Thibet, Ismailians and Fireworshippers.
They all argued about the nature of God, and how He
should be worshipped. Each of them asserted that in
his country alone was the true God known and rightly
worshipped.
Every one argued and shouted, except a
Chinaman, a student of Confucius, who sat quietly
in one corner of the coffee-house, not joining in the
dispute. He sat there drinking tea and listening to what
the others said, but did not speak himself.
The Turk noticed him sitting there, and
appealed to him, saying:
“You can confirm what I say, my good Chinaman.
You hold your peace, but if you spoke I know you
would uphold my opinion. Traders from your country,
who come to me for assistance, tell me that though
many religions have been introduced into China, you
Chinese consider Mohammedanism the best of all, and
adopt it willingly. Confirm, then, my words, and tell us
your opinion of the true God and of His prophet.”
“Yes, yes,” said the rest, turning to the Chinaman,
“let us hear what you think on the subject.”
The Chinaman, the student of Confucius,
closed his eyes, and thought a while. Then he opened
them again, and drawing his hands out of the wide
sleeves of his garment, and folding them on his breast,
he spoke as follows, in a calm and quiet voice.
Sirs, it seems to me that it is chiefly pride that
prevents men agreeing with one another on matters of
faith. If you care to listen to me, I will tell you a story
which will explain this by an example.
I came here from China on an English steamer
which had been round the world. We stopped for fresh
water, and landed on the east coast of the island of
Sumatra. It was midday, and some of us, having landed,
sat in the shade of some cocoanut palms by the seashore,
not far from a native village. We were a party of men of
different nationalities.
As we sat there, a blind man approached us. We
learned afterwards that he had gone blind from gazing
too long and too persistently at the sun, trying to find
out what it is, in order to seize its light.
He strove a long time to accomplish this,
constantly looking at the sun; but the only result was
that his eyes were injured by its brightness, and he
became blind.
Then he said to himself:
“The light of the sun is not a liquid; for if it
were a liquid it would be possible to pour it from one
vessel into another, and it would be moved, like water,
by the wind. Neither is it fire; for if it were fire, water
would extinguish it. Neither is light a spirit, for it is
seen by the eye; nor is it matter, for it cannot be moved.
Therefore, as the light of the sun is neither liquid, nor
fire, nor spirit, nor matter, it is—nothing!”
So he argued, and, as a result of always looking
at the sun and always thinking about it, he lost both his
sight and his reason. And when he went quite blind, he
became fully convinced that the sun did not exist.
With this blind man came a slave, who after
placing his master in the shade of a cocoanut tree,
picked up a cocoanut from the ground, and began
making it into a night-light. He twisted a wick from the
fibre of the cocoanut: squeezed oil from the nut in the
shell, and soaked the wick in it.
As the slave sat doing this, the blind man sighed
and said to him:
“Well, slave, was I not right when I told you
there is no sun? Do you not see how dark it is? Yet
people say there is a sun. . . . But if so, what is it?”
“I do not know what the sun is,” said the slave.
“That is no business of mine. But I know what light is.
Here I have made a night-light, by the help of which I
can serve you and find anything I want in the hut.”
And the slave picked up the cocoanut shell,
saying: “This is my sun.”
15
A lame man with crutches, who was sitting near
by, heard these words, and laughed:
“You have evidently been blind all your life,”
said he to the blind man, “not to know what the sun is.
I will tell you what it is. The sun is a ball of fire, which
rises every morning out of the sea and
goes down again among the mountains of our island
each evening. We have all seen this, and if you had had
your eyesight you too would have seen it.”
A fisherman, who had been listening to the
conversation said:
“It is plain enough that you have never been
beyond your own island. If you were not lame, and if
you had been out as I have in a fishing-boat, you would
know that the sun does not set among the mountains of
our island, but as it rises from the ocean every morning
so it sets again in the sea every night. What I am telling
you is true, for I see it every day with my own eyes.”
Then an Indian who was of our party, interrupted
him by saying:
“I am astonished that a reasonable man should
talk such nonsense. How can a ball of fire possibly
descend into the water and not be extinguished? The
sun is not a ball of fire at all, it is the Deity named
Deva, who rides for ever in a chariot round the golden
mountain, Meru. Sometimes the evil serpents Ragu
and Ketu attack Deva and swallow him: and then the
earth is dark. But our priests pray that the Deity may
be released, and then he is set free. Only such ignorant
men as you, who have never been beyond their own
island, can imagine that the sun shines for their country
alone.”
Then the master of an Egyptian vessel, who was
present, spoke in his turn.
“No,” said he, “you also are wrong. The sun is
not a Deity, and does not move only round India and
its golden mountain. I have sailed much on the Black
Sea, and along the coasts of Arabia, and have been to
Madagascar and to the Philippines. The sun lights the
whole earth, and not India alone. It does not circle
round one mountain, but rises far in the East, beyond
the Isles of Japan, and sets far, far away in the West,
beyond the islands of England. That is why the Japanese
call their country ‘Nippon,’ that is, ‘the birth of the
sun.’ I know this well, for I have myself seen much, and
heard more from my grandfather, who sailed to the very
ends of the sea.”
He would have gone on, but an English sailor
from our ship interrupted him.
“There is no country,” he said “where people
know so much about the sun’s movements as in
England. The sun, as every one in England knows, rises
nowhere and sets nowhere. It is always moving round
the earth. We can be sure of this for we have just been
round the world ourselves, and nowhere knocked up
against the sun. Wherever we went, the sun showed
itself in the morning and hid itself at night, just as it
does here.”
And the Englishman took a stick and, drawing
circles on the sand, tried to explain how the sun moves
in the heavens and goes round the world. But he was
unable to explain it clearly, and pointing to the ship’s
pilot said:
“This man knows more about it than I do. He
can explain it properly.”
The pilot, who was an intelligent man, had
listened in silence to the talk till he was asked to speak.
Now every one turned to him, and he said:
“You are all misleading one another, and are
yourselves deceived. The sun does not go round the
earth, but the earth goes round the sun, revolving as it
goes, and turning towards the sun in the course of each
twenty-four hours, not only Japan, and the Philippines,
and Sumatra where we now are, but Africa, and Europe,
and America, and many lands besides. The sun does not
shine for some one mountain, or for some one island,
or for some one sea, nor even for one earth alone, but
for other planets as well as our earth. If you would
only look up at the heavens, instead of at the ground
beneath your own feet, you might all understand this,
and would then no longer suppose that the sun shines
for you, or for your country alone.”
Thus spoke the wise pilot, who had voyaged
much about the world, and had gazed much upon the
heavens above.
“So on matters of faith,” continued the
Chinaman, the student of Confucius, “it is pride that
causes error and discord among men. As with the sun,
so it is with God. Each man wants to have a special God
of his own, or at least a special God for his native land.
Each nation wishes to confine in its own temples Him,
whom the world cannot contain.
“Can any temple compare with that which God
Himself has built to unite all men in one faith and one
religion?
“All human temples are built on the model
16
of this temple, which is God’s own world. Every
temple has its fonts, its vaulted roof, its lamps, its
pictures or sculptures, its inscriptions, its books of
the law, its offerings, its altars and its priests. But
in what temple is there such a font as the ocean;
such a vault as that of
the heavens; such lamps as the sun, moon, and
stars; or any figures to be compared with living,
loving, mutually-helpful men? Where are there any
records of God’s goodness so easy to understand
as the blessings which God has strewn abroad for
man’s happiness? Where is there any book of the
law so clear to each man as that written in his heart?
What sacrifices equal the self-denials which loving
men and women make for one another? And what
altar can be compared with the heart of a good
man, on which God Himself accepts the sacrifice?
“The higher a man’s conception of God,
the better will he know Him. And the better he
knows God, the nearer will he draw to Him,
imitating His goodness, His mercy, and His love of
man.
“Therefore, let him who sees the sun’s
whole light filling the world, refrain from blaming
or despising the superstitious man, who in his
own idol sees one ray of that same light. Let him
not despise even the unbeliever who is blind and
cannot see the sun at all.”
So spoke the Chinaman, the student of
Confucius; and all who were present in the coffeehouse
were silent, and disputed no more as to
whose faith was the best.
