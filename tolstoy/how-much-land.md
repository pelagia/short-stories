## How much land does a man need? by Tolstoy

The ambitious peasant Pakhom, who, after
gaining ever greater plots of land, finally heard of a
wonderful deal in a far-off country. He travelled to the
land of the Bashkirs and negotiated with the village
elder, who seemed a fool. The elder told Pakhom that
he could have all the land he wanted for a thousand
rubles a day.
Pakhom did not understand. “What kind of
rate is that - a day?” he asked. “How many acres could
that be?”
“We don’t reckon your way. We sell by the day. However
much you can walk around in one day will be yours.”
When Pakhon expressed that a man can walk
around much land in one day, the elder burst out
laughing. “And all of it will be yours!” he replied. But
there was one condition: If Pakhom didn’t return to
the starting point by sundown, the money would be
forfeited.
Ecstatic, Pakhom spent a sleepless night. Rising
at dawn, he went with the villagers to the top of a hill
where the elder put down his hat. After placing his
thousand rubles on top, Pakhom began walking, digging
holes along the way to mark his land. The going was
easy and he thought,”I’ll do another three miles and
then turn left. The land’s so beautiful here, it would be
a pity to miss any.”
Pakhom hurried throughout the morning,
going out of his way to add more land. But at noon
when he looked back at the hill where he had began, it
was difficult to see the people. Maybe I have gone too
far, he worried, and decided he must begin to make
shorter sides. As the afternoon wore on, the heat was
exhausting. By now his bare feet were cut and bruished,
and his legs weakened. He wanted to rest, but it was out
of question.
Pakhom struggled on, walking faster, then
running. He worried that he had been too greedy and
his fear made him breathless. On he ran, his shirt soaked
and his throat parched. His lungs were working like a
blacksmith’s bellows, his heart beat like a hammer. He
was terrified.
All these strain will be the death of me.
Although Pakhom feared death, he couldn’t
stop. They’d call me an idiot, he thought. When he
was close enough to hear the Bashkirs cheering, he
summoned his last ounce of strength and kept running.
As he finally reached the hill, everything suddenly
became dark—the sun had set. Pakhom groaned. He
wanted to stop, but heard the Bashkirs still cheering
him on. He realized that from where he was at the
bottom of the hill, the sun had set - but not for those
on top. Pakhom took a deep breath and rushed up the
hill. Reaching the top, he saw the elder sitting by the
hat, laughing his head off. Pakhom’s legs gave way, and
he fell forward grasping the cap.
“Oh well done,” exclaimed the elder.
“That’s a lot of land you’ve earned yourself!”
Pakhom’s worker ran up and tried to lift his
master, but Pakhom was dead. The worker picked up
Pakhom’s spade, dug a grave, and buried him - six feet
from head to heel, exactly the amount of land a man
needs.
